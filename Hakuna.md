This is my Cat Hakuna Matata. She is currently 4 years old and turning 5 on August 18! She is a picky eating and but loves her freeze dried chicken snacks. She is an active girlie and loves to play. If you got bored learning about me and my project, take a break and look at these adorable photos of her:)
