<h1>Hey, I'm Eva :)</h1>

<p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm currently an M.Eng student in ORIE at Cornell and getting ready to start as a Quant Analyst at Bank of America. Here’s what I’ve been up to lately:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Finalizing my sales trend automation work + wine brand demand analysis at Gallo.</li>
  <li><strong>Planning:</strong> My grad trip with my family to Japan this summer as well as my move to NYC this summer. </li>
  <li><strong>Recent joy:</strong> Spending the last couple of weeks of college with friends and enjoying the last couple of sunsets on the slope. </li>
</ul>
