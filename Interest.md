## Clubs Involvement – [Cornell International Student Union (ISU)](https://isucornell.com/)
During my time at Cornell, I was actively involved in the [Cornell International Student Union (ISU)](https://isucornell.com/), where I helped create a welcoming and inclusive environment for international students. I contributed to planning and hosting large-scale events, including the International GALA, which brought together over 2,000 attendees and celebrated diverse cultures across campus. Through this role, I also provided guidance, resources, and support to help international students navigate life at Cornell and feel more at home in the community.

## Interest & Hobbies 
Outside of academics and work, I enjoy staying active and spending quality time with the people I care about. I used to train competitively in badminton during elementary and middle school, and while I no longer compete, I still love playing casually with friends. I also enjoy working out and swimming as ways to unwind and stay healthy. Some of my favorite moments are wine nights with friends, cozy family dinners, and exploring new places when I travel. I also have a growing passion for baking and cooking—there’s something especially rewarding about trying out new recipes and sharing homemade food with others.

#### Foodie Moments
Here are some photos from hangouts with my friends and family! Don't get hungry :)
