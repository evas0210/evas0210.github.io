Here are some projects I've worked on:

## Predictive Model for Pricing Swaps and Swaptions
At Bank of America, I developed and refined predictive models to price swaps and swaptions, ensuring they reflected current market behavior and matched trading desk outputs. I also automated the bilateral inflation curve calibration and submission process using Python, resulting in full compliance with internal risk assessments and significantly reducing manual workload.
Tools: Python, Excel, Bloomberg Terminal

## Retail Sales Trend Analysis for Gallo Winery
I built a fully automated analytics pipeline for E. & J. Gallo Winery to analyze retail sales trends year over year. The tool identifies brand cannibalization, tracks high- and low-performing brands by region and category, and evaluates price elasticity to guide promotion and pricing strategy. It helps Gallo generate consistent insights across datasets and enables faster, data-driven decisions with minimal manual effort.
Tools: Python, Excel, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, SQL

## IT Audit Automation and Risk Analysis
At Cornellâ€™s Office of Compliance and Risk, I conducted IT audits by applying data analysis techniques to perform sample testing and assign maturity ratings based on NIST cybersecurity guidelines. I identified risk areas, evaluated IT system controls, and provided actionable recommendations to strengthen security posture and ensure policy compliance.
Tools: Excel, Python

## Teaching Assitant 
As a Teaching Assistant for the Cornell College of Engineering for ORIE 3150 and ORIE 3120, I led weekly discussion sessions and hosted office hours to support student learning. I helped clarify technical content and guided students through hands-on exercises, enhancing their understanding of engineering problem-solving techniques and course materials.

## Leak Forecast Model Optimization
While interning at JANA Corporation, I worked on optimizing their leak prediction model by refining parameters like beta, eta, and gamma based on historical failure data. Using SQL and Excel, I adjusted the underlying data structure and improved the accuracy of failure forecasts, allowing the team to proactively prevent future system issues.
Tools: SQL, Excel, Statistical Modeling
